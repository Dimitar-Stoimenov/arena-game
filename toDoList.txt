---bugs:
debuff cooldowns are not properly calculated - they get 1 additional turn of cooldown...
only basic damage and mana burn are calcualted properly


--- gameplay
* Make cleanse dispel poison effects (when Wound Poison is added);
* Add more effects:
    -hot; e.effect = 'healOverTime'
* Add character pickers - move the characterState out of Battle.js;
* Replace mana with rage and energy for warriors and rogues (maybe feral druids?) /pseudo mana/;
* Add warlock sacrifice pet for shield (excluding Demon lock)... 
    Demon lock pet is Felguard with Intercept and Cleave abilities.
    Affliction Lock has Devour Magic and Felhunter pet and Siphon Life ability.
