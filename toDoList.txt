---bugs:
* doing aoe triggers health changes on dead targets... prevent doing damage on a dead target... or changing the dead target mana
* lower demon pet damage, maybe stun should be removed... done lowering
* make dots unstackable
* when a dot is applied, check if the same dot exists, if it does replace it with the new one.
* add lock pet and spec images

* very low prio, maybe turn into a feature? :) - reset petTarget prop in attacker state because abilities are usable when previous target of pet is dead...


--- gameplay
* Make cleanse dispel poison effects (when Wound Poison is added);
* Add more effects:
    -hot; e.effect = 'healOverTime'
* Add character pickers - move the characterState out of Battle.js;
* Replace mana with rage and energy for warriors and rogues (maybe feral druids?) /pseudo mana/;
* Add warlock sacrifice pet for shield (excluding Demon lock)... 
    Demon lock pet is Felguard with Intercept and Cleave abilities.
    Affliction Lock has Devour Magic and Felhunter pet and Siphon Life ability.
